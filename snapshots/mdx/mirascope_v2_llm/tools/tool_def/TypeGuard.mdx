## <ApiType type="Alias" path="tools/tool_def/TypeGuard" symbolName="TypeGuard" /> TypeGuard

Special typing form used to annotate the return type of a user-defined
type guard function.  ``TypeGuard`` only accepts a single type argument.
At runtime, functions marked this way should return a boolean.

``TypeGuard`` aims to benefit *type narrowing* -- a technique used by static
type checkers to determine a more precise type of an expression within a
program's code flow.  Usually type narrowing is done by analyzing
conditional code flow and applying the narrowing to a block of code.  The
conditional expression here is sometimes referred to as a "type guard".

Sometimes it would be convenient to use a user-defined boolean function
as a type guard.  Such a function should use ``TypeGuard[...]`` as its
return type to alert static type checkers to this intention.

Using  ``-> TypeGuard`` tells the static type checker that for a given
function:

1. The return value is a boolean.
2. If the return value is ``True``, the type of its argument
   is the type inside ``TypeGuard``.

   For example::

      def is_str(val: Union[str, float]):
          # "isinstance" type guard
          if isinstance(val, str):
              # Type of ``val`` is narrowed to ``str``
              ...
          else:
              # Else, type of ``val`` is narrowed to ``float``.
              ...

Strict type narrowing is not enforced -- ``TypeB`` need not be a narrower
form of ``TypeA`` (it can even be a wider form) and this may lead to
type-unsafe results.  The main reason is to allow for things like
narrowing ``List[object]`` to ``List[str]`` even though the latter is not
a subtype of the former, since ``List`` is invariant.  The responsibility of
writing type-safe type guards is left to the user.

``TypeGuard`` also works with type variables.  For more information, see
PEP 647 (User-Defined Type Guards).
