# stream

Interface for streaming responses from LLMs.

TODO: this interface is missing stuff from v1 like usage etc. that we collect during
the stream for convenience (e.g. calling stream.cost after the stream is done).

## <ApiType type="Alias" path="responses/stream/index" symbolName="StreamChunk" /> StreamChunk

A chunk of a streaming response from an LLM.

## <ApiType type="Class" path="responses/stream/index" symbolName="Stream" /> Stream

A synchronous stream of response chunks from an LLM.
