# context_stream

Interface for streaming responses with context from LLMs.

This module defines interfaces for streaming responses from language models that have
contextual information or data, such as the history of messages and dependencies used to
generate the response.

TODO: this interface is missing stuff from v1 like usage etc. that we collect during
the stream for convenience (e.g. calling stream.cost after the stream is done).

## <ApiType type="Alias" path="responses/context_stream/index" symbolName="ContextStreamChunk" /> ContextStreamChunk

A chunk of a streaming response from a contextual LLM call.

## <ApiType type="Class" path="responses/context_stream/index" symbolName="ContextStream" /> ContextStream

A synchronous stream of response chunks from an LLM with context.
