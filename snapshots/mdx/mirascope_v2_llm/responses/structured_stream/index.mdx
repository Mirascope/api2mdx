# structured_stream

Interfaces for streaming structured responses from LLMs.

This module provides interfaces for both synchronous and asynchronous streaming
of responses from language models. Streaming allows for incremental processing of
responses as they are generated, rather than waiting for the complete response.

TODO: this interface is missing stuff from v1 like usage etc. that we collect during
the stream for convenience (e.g. calling stream.cost after the stream is done).

## <ApiType type="Alias" path="responses/structured_stream/index" symbolName="Dataclass" /> Dataclass

## <ApiType type="Alias" path="responses/structured_stream/index" symbolName="StreamChunk" /> StreamChunk

A chunk of a streaming response from an LLM.

## <ApiType type="Class" path="responses/structured_stream/index" symbolName="StructuredStream" /> StructuredStream

A synchronous stream of partial structured outputs from an LLM.
