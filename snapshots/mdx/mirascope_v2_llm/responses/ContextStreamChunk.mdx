## <ApiType type="Alias" path="responses/ContextStreamChunk" symbolName="ContextStreamChunk" /> ContextStreamChunk

A chunk of a streaming response from a contextual LLM call.

Context stream chunks represent incremental pieces of a response that are delivered
as they are generated by the model, allowing for real-time display and processing
with access to the context dependencies.
