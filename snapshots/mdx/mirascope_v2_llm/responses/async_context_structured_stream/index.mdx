# async_context_structured_stream

Interface for streaming structured responses asynchronously with context from LLMs.

This module provides interfaces for asynchronous streaming of structured responses from
language models with context. Streaming allows for incremental processing of responses
as they are generated, rather than waiting for the complete response.

TODO: this interface is missing stuff from v1 like usage etc. that we collect during
the stream for convenience (e.g. calling stream.cost after the stream is done).
