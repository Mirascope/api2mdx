# async_context_stream

Interface for streaming responses asynchronously with context from LLMs.

This module defines interfaces for streaming responses asynchronously from language models
that have contextual information or data, such as the history of messages and dependencies
used to generate the response.

TODO: this interface is missing stuff from v1 like usage etc. that we collect during
the stream for convenience (e.g. calling stream.cost after the stream is done).

## <ApiType type="Alias" path="responses/async_context_stream/index" symbolName="AsyncIterator" /> AsyncIterator

## <ApiType type="Alias" path="responses/async_context_stream/index" symbolName="ContextStreamChunk" /> ContextStreamChunk

A chunk of a streaming response from a contextual LLM call.

## <ApiType type="Class" path="responses/async_context_stream/index" symbolName="AsyncContextStream" /> AsyncContextStream

An asynchronous stream of response chunks from an LLM with context.
