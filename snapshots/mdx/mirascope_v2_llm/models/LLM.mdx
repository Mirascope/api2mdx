# LLM

## <ApiType type="Alias" path="models/LLM" symbolName="LLM" /> LLM

The base interface for LLM models.

This class defines the interface for interacting with language models from
various providers. It handles the common operations like generating responses,
streaming, and async variants of these operations.

Implementations of this class for specific providers should extend it and
implement the abstract methods for calls and streaming.
