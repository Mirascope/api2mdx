# ResponseFormat

## <ApiType type="Alias" path="response_formatting/ResponseFormat" symbolName="ResponseFormat" /> ResponseFormat

Class representing a structured output format for LLM responses.

A ResponseFormat defines how LLM responses should be structured and parsed.
It includes metadata about the format mode, whether to use strict validation,
and the schema for the expected output.

This class is not instantiated directly but is created by applying the
`@response_format()` decorator to a class definition.

When decorated with `@response_format()`, the class retains its original
fields and constructor, while adding the ResponseFormat functionality:


**Alias to:** `mirascope_v2_llm.response_formatting.response_format.ResponseFormat`
