# FromCallArgs

## <ApiType type="Alias" path="response_formatting/FromCallArgs" symbolName="FromCallArgs" /> FromCallArgs

A marker class for indicating that a field is a call argument.

This ensures that the LLM call does not attempt to generate this field. Instead, it
will populate this field with the call argument with a matching name.

This is useful for colocating e.g. validation of a generated output against and
input argument (such as the length of an output given a number input).


**Alias to:** `mirascope_v2_llm.response_formatting.from_call_args.FromCallArgs`
