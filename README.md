# api2mdx

`api2mdx` is a Python tool that generates `mdx` documentation for Python APIs.
Under the hood, it uses Griffe.

`api2mdx` is designed to work in tandem with custom components like `<ParametersTable>`, `<ApiSignature>`, etc. Currently they live in `@mirascope/website` or `@mirascope/docs-viewer`, but later they will be extracted to `@mirascope/ui`.
